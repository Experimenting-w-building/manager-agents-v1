# Workflow Management System

## Overview
This repository contains a workflow management system designed to facilitate the processing of tasks through a series of agents. The system allows for dynamic transitions between states based on conditions defined in the workflow.

### Example Execution
You can test the system with sample queries by modifying the `main.py` file. The example execution at the bottom of the file demonstrates how to process a query using the framework manager.

### Configuration
You may need to configure certain parameters in the `main.py` file to suit your environment, such as API keys for the various agents.

## Workflow Structure
The workflow is defined in `main.py`. Key components include:

- **States**: Each state represents a step in the workflow.
- **Transitions**: Conditional edges that determine the flow based on specific criteria.
- **Agents**: Functions or classes that perform tasks within the workflow.

### Example of Defining a New State
Here's a brief example of how to define a new state and its transitions:
```python
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "new_state",
    condition_function,
    {
        "next": "next_state",
        "end": "final_state"
    }
)
```
